{"name":"Docula","tagline":"A simple and light weight API Usage & Developer Document generator for PHP","body":"# Docula\r\nA simple and light weight API &amp; Developer document generator for PHP applications. Now generate the API Usage Documentation along with developer documentation. This supports custom themes, manual text interventions, editing and cool graphical presentations. Targeted at real world API documentation needs and not limited to developer documentation like the most of the other applications.\r\n## Why Docula?\r\nAll the other documentation generators go through your _individual_ files and create documenation based on the **docBlock** style comments. This is great. It does generate usable and sometimes, good looking documenations. The only caveat is that these are always talking about **developer** documentation in terms of _classes_ and _methods_.\r\n\r\nWhen generating documenation, it is of essence that the **true** usability be glorified via **API Usage** documents. Now, **Docula** combines both and gives you traditional _docBlock_ developer documentation and also _API Usage_ documentation - all in **one static site with search features and HTML5 compliance**. And you can also use your own _themes_.\r\n","google":"UA-68417828-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
